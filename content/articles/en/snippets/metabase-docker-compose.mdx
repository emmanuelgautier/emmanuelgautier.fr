Metabase is a Free and Open Source Business Intelligence and Dashboarding platform. It allows employees to answer some questions thanks to the data visualization.

To make some tests or developments, it can be useful to deploy the local environment. One way is to create a local Docker environment. Metabase provides an official Docker image.

Here you can find a `docker-compose` file with the Metabase image and a Postgres database. You will need to configure the Metabase instance by yourself.

First of all, you have to create a `db_user.txt` and `db_password.txt` files with the postgres credentials. This database is not the one containing the business data but the DB with all the metabase configurations.
