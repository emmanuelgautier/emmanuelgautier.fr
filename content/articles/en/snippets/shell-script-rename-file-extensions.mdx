Sometimes we need to rename the extension of multiple files extension in the current directory. Here some shell script snippets to do that in different cases.

## Markdown to MDX

If you want to move from `markdown` with `.md` extension to `.mdx`:

```shell rename-multiple-files-extensions-markdown.sh
for x in **/*.md; do mv "$x" "${x%.md}.mdx"; done
```

## Javascript to Typescript

If you want to move from a Javascript project with `.js` files extension to Typescript files with `.ts` extension:

```shell rename-multiple-files-extensions-typescript.sh
for x in **/*.js; do mv "$x" "${x%.md}.ts"; done
```
