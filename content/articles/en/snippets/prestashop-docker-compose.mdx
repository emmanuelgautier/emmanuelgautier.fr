PrestaShop is a free and open-source e-commerce platform that allows individuals and businesses to create online stores and sell products and services. It was first released in 2007 and has since become one of the most widely used e-commerce platforms in the world, with a large community of developers and users.

PrestaShop is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database. It is available in multiple languages and can be customized to meet the specific needs of different businesses and industries.

To make some development, it can be useful to deploy a local environment. One way is to create a local Docker environment. Prestashop provides an official Docker image. Prestashop support main versions for now which are Prestashop 1.7 (1.7.x) and Prestashop 8 (8.x). Let's see how to a create local environment for those both versions.

If you just need to start a shop and you do not want to manage the hosting, you still can launch your store with Prestashop managed hosting [Edition](https://l.emmanuelgautier.com/prestashop-edition).
