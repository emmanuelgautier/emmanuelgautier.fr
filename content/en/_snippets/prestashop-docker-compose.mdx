Prestashop is a Free and Open Source E-Commerce platform written in PHP. It allows users to deploy their own shop. They have also a great addons marketplace to extend Prestashop functionalities.

To make some development, it can be useful to deploy the local environment. One way is to create a local Docker environment. Prestashop provides an official Docker image.

Here you can find a `docker-compose` file with the Prestashop image and a MySQL database. The installation is automatically installed with a demo shop ready to play with.
