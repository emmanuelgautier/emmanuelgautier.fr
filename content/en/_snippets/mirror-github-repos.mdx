In some cases, it is useful to mirror a repository on GitHub. Unfortunately, Github does not provide an automatic mirroring feature so far. The only way to make mirroring is to do it yourself [manually](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) or automate it. Thanks to Github Actions, we will be able to mirror a repository on GitHub automatically.

To do so, we will need to create a new repository on GitHub and then we will need to create a new Github action using `repo-sync/github-sync` action. You can copy the code below and paste it into your mirrored repository.

```yaml:.github/workflows/repo-sync.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  repo-sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: repo-sync
        uses: repo-sync/github-sync@v2
        with:
          source_repo: 'org/repo'
          source_branch: 'main'
          destination_branch: 'main'
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

You will need to update the `source_repo`, `source_branch`, and `destination_branch` values to match your repository.

Do not forget to fill in the `PAT` Github secret. For creating a new Personal Access Token, please follow the [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
