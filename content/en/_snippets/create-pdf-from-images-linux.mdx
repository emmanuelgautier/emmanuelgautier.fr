Hey there! Today, I want to share a nifty little trick that I recently discovered and help me a lot – how to merge a bunch of images into a single PDF file using the Linux command line. So, let's dive right into it!

## The Command: convert (from the ImageMagick Package)

The magic tool that we're going to use here is `convert`, which is a part of the `ImageMagick` package – a powerful suite of command-line tools for image manipulation. If you don't have it installed, you can usually install it using your package manager. For instance, on Debian-based systems, you'd run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

## Configuring ImageMagick Policies for PDF Writing

ImageMagick's security policies are designed to ensure that image and file operations are performed in a safe and secure manner, preventing potential abuses. This means that certain features, such as writing PDF files, might be disabled by default for security reasons.

It PDF writing is disable you may encounter this error:

```bash
attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy 'PDF' @ error/constitute.c/IsCoderAuthorized/421
```

To enable writing PDF files using the `convert` command, you'll need to modify ImageMagick's security policies. Here's how to do it:

1. Locate the policy file: ImageMagick's policy files are usually located in the `/etc/ImageMagick-<version>/` directory. The file name is `policy.xml`.

2. Edit the policy file: Open the `policy.xml` file with a text editor as an administrator (use sudo for administrative rights).

3. Find the `<policymap>` section: Inside the policy.xml file, you'll find a `<policymap>` section. This is where you'll define policies for each file format.

4. Enable PDF writing: To enable writing PDF files, locate the line that corresponds to the PDF pattern. Modify the value of rights to allow PDF writing. For example:

```xml
<policy domain="coder" rights="read | write" pattern="PDF" />
```

## The Command Syntax

The basic syntax of the `convert` command for merging images into a PDF is as follows:

```bash
convert image1.jpg image2.png output.pdf
```

You simply list the input images in the order you want them to appear in the PDF, followed by the desired output PDF file name.

## Combining Multiple Images

But what if you have a bunch of images in a folder that you want to merge in a specific order? No worries, we can use shell globbing to our advantage. Here's how:

```bash
convert *.jpg output.pdf
```

This command would merge all the JPEG images in the current folder into a single PDF named `output.pdf`.
