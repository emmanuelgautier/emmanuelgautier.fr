title: Ory OAthKeeper with Envoy Proxy, Prometheus and Jaeger Docker Compose
description:
  Ory OAthKeeper is a great Open Source Identity and Access Proxy (IAP). It can be deployed as a reverse proxy or as a control decision engine deployed with a reverse proxy. Most of the time, services are already deployed with a proxy like an Nginx or an Envoy. If you want to deploy for production, you may want to have metrics and distributed tracing as well.

Ory [OAthKeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a great Open Source Identity and Access Proxy (IAP). It can be deployed as a reverse proxy or as a control decision engine deployed with a reverse proxy. Most of the time, services are already deployed with a proxy like an Nginx or an Envoy. If you want to deploy for production, you may want to have metrics and distributed tracing as well. So, here is a docker-compose with all those components:

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'

services:
  oathkeeper:
    image: oryd/oathkeeper
    container_name: oathkeeper
    ports:
      - "4455:4455"
      - "4456:4456"
      - "9000:9000"
    depends_on:
      - jaeger
    command: serve --config=/etc/config/oathkeeper/config.yaml
    environment:
      - TRACING_PROVIDER=jaeger
      - TRACING_PROVIDERS_JAEGER_PROPAGATION=jaeger
      - TRACING_PROVIDERS_JAEGER_SAMPLING_SERVER_URL=http://jaeger:5778/sampling
      - TRACING_PROVIDERS_JAEGER_LOCAL_AGENT_ADDRESS=jaeger:6831
      - TRACING_PROVIDERS_JAEGER_SAMPLING_TYPE=const
      - TRACING_PROVIDERS_JAEGER_SAMPLING_VALUE=1
    volumes:
      - ./oathkeeper:/etc/config/oathkeeper
    restart: on-failure
    networks:
      - intranet

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.12.0
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    depends_on:
      - oathkeeper
    command: --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus:/etc/prometheus
    networks:
      - intranet

  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one
    container_name: jaeger
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=9411
    ports:
      - "16686:16686" # The UI port
    networks:
      - intranet

  envoy:
    image: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.25-latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - oathkeeper
    volumes:
      - ./envoy/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml
    networks:
      - intranet

networks:
  intranet:
```

You also need an OAthKeeper configuration. Do not forget to add your own rules file. To know how to define rules, have a look at the [Ory documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/api-access-rules).

This example authenticates tokens issued by the Google Identity provider. If you want to authenticate against another provider, you should change this configuration and put the right JWKS URLs.

```yaml:./oathkeeper/config.yaml
serve:
  proxy:
    port: 4455 # run the proxy at port 4455
  api:
    port: 4456 # run the api at port 4456
  prometheus:
    port: 9000
    metrics_path: /metrics

access_rules:
  repositories:
    - file:///etc/config/oathkeeper/your-rule.json

errors:
  fallback:
    - json
  handlers:
    json:
      enabled: true
      config:
        verbose: true

mutators:
  noop:
    enabled: true

authorizers:
  allow:
    enabled: true
  deny:
    enabled: true

authenticators:
  noop:
    enabled: true

  anonymous:
    enabled: true
    config:
      subject: guest

  jwt:
    enabled: true
    config:
      jwks_urls:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com
      scope_strategy: hierarchic
```

The prometheus scrapper configuration for OAthKeeper.

```yaml:./prometheus/prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'oathkeeper'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      # The target needs to match what you've configured above
      - targets: ['oathkeeper:9000']

```

And an Envoy configuration file to use OAthKeeper and configure Zipkin tracing.

```yaml:./envoy/envoy.yaml
admin:
  address:
    socket_address:
      protocol: TCP
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port_value: 9901
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address:
        protocol: TCP
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 8081

              routes:
