In this snippet, I will show you how to create a custom React component for outbound links that includes specific attributes for SEO concerns, such as rel="noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank".

This code defines a simple and reusable React component that renders an outbound link (`<a>` element) with recommended security attributes. It is designed to be flexible and easily customizable with additional props.

```typescript
import React from 'react'

interface OutboundLinkProps extends React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>, HTMLAnchorElement> {}

const OutboundLink: React.FC<OutboundLinkProps> = ({
  rel='nofollow noopener noreferrer',
  ...props
}) => (
  <a target="_blank" rel={rel} {...props} />
)

export default OutboundLink
```

The interface `OutboundLinkProps` declaration defines the props expected by the `OutboundLink` component. It extends the type used by the `a` element rendered by React.

Within the component, the rel prop is set to `'nofollow noopener noreferrer'` by default, which is a recommended set of values for security purposes. These values prevent the linked page from being able to access the `window` object of the linking page, which could potentially be used for malicious purposes.
