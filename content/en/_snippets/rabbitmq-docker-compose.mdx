The following RabbitMQ Docker Compose aims to simplify the deployment and management of RabbitMQ instances using Docker for local development purposes. The RabbitMQ Docker Compose file includes the following services:

- RabbitMQ: The RabbitMQ service is the main service that runs the RabbitMQ server.
- RabbitMQ Management: The RabbitMQ Management service provides a web-based management interface for RabbitMQ.

```yaml
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: guest
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: guest
```

To use the RabbitMQ Docker Compose file, create a new directory and save the above content in a file named `docker-compose.yml`. Then, run the following command to start the RabbitMQ services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After running the command, you can access the RabbitMQ Management interface by visiting `http://localhost:15672` in your web browser. The default username and password for the RabbitMQ Management interface are `guest` and `guest`, respectively.

You can find more information about the RabbitMQ Docker image and its configuration options in the [official RabbitMQ Docker image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq).
