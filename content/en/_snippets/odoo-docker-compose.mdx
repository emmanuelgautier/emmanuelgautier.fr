Odoo is an Free and Open Source ERP and CRM platform. This solution has a lot of features including CRM, ERP but also E-Commerce, Project Management, ... etc.

To make some tests or developments, it can be useful to deploy the local environment. One way is to create a local Docker environment. Odoo provides an official Docker image.

Here you can find a `docker-compose` file with the Odoo image and a Postgres database. You will need to configure the Odoo instance by yourself.

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: '3.9'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    restart: always

  odoo:
    image: odoo:15
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
      - "8072:8072" # live chat
    environment:
      - HOST=db
      - USER=odoo
      - PASSWORD=odoo
```
