Hey there, fellow developers! Today, I was looking for a ready and simple docker compose file using the [redis/redis-stack-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server) docker image but I did not find anything. So, I am sharing here the one I created if that can help you too.

## Create the Docker Compose file

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
version: "3.6"

services:
  redis:
    image: redis/redis-stack-server:7.2.0-v6
    ports:
      - 6379:6379
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "redis-cli", "--raw", "incr", "ping" ]
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

volumes:
  redis_data:
```

Explanations:
- `healthcheck`: Defines a health check for the container. The healthcheck runs the specified command `redis-cli --raw incr ping` to check if the Redis server is responding properly.
- `volumes`: Creates a volume named redis_data. This volume is used to persist data, ensuring that even if the container is stopped or removed, the data stored by Redis remains accessible in subsequent container runs.

## Run the Redis stack

Save the `docker-compose.yml` file and run this in your terminal:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify the Redis setup

Now, go ahead and open your favorite Redis client and connect to `localhost:6379`.
