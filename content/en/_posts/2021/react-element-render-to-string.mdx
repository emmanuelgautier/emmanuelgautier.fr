What happens when you want to render a React string or element to an HTML string? For some reasons, you may want to have the generated HTML string from your React component instead of a mounted component and render it on the page.

If you want to render an HTML String for SSR purposes, you may consider using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) instead of manually rendering a React string to HTML. Using a framework like Next.js can offer a wide range of features and tools for building server-rendered applications like abstracting away a lot of the complexity of setting up server rendering, automatic code splitting, significant performance improvements, ... etc.

## What is ReactDOMServer?

The ReactDOMServer module is a part of the official React library. It provides methods for rendering React components to static HTML. It's useful for server-side rendering, where you want to generate HTML on the server and send it to the client.

## Converting a React String to an HTML String

To convert a React string to an HTML string, we need to use the renderToString method provided by ReactDOMServer. The renderToString method takes a React component as an argument and returns a string of HTML.

Here is an example of how to use the renderToString method to convert a React string to an HTML string:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';

const reactString = '<div>Hello, world!</div>';
const htmlString = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(React.createElement('div', { dangerouslySetInnerHTML: { __html: reactString } }));

console.log(htmlString);
// Output: <div>Hello, world!</div>
```

In this example, we are using React.createElement to create a React element with the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop set to `{ __html: reactString }`. The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop is used to render HTML directly to the page. Then, the `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` function convert the React element to an HTML string.

Here is another example but with a custom component you already created before. This example convert a JSX to string.

```jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'

renderToString(<YourAwesomeComponent props1="value1" props2={{ value: '2' }} />)
```

The `renderToString` function can be used on both server-side and client-side. If you want to render all page server-side for SEO or UX purposes for example, you can use the `ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream` function to improve your load time or the `ReactDOMServer.renderToPipeableStream` in newer React versions. You can find an example for this last method on the [renderToPipeableStream Documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream#rendering-a-react-tree-as-html-to-a-nodejs-stream).
