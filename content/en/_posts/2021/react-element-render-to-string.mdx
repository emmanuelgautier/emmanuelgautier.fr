For use cases, you may want to have the generated HTML string from your React component instead of a mounted component rendered on the page.

The simplest way is to use the `renderToString` function provided by the `react-dom` package :

```jsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'

renderToString(<YourAwesomeComponent props1="value1" props2={{ value: '2' }} />)
```

The function `renderToString` can be used on both the server-side and client-side.

If you want to render all page server-side for SEO or UX purposes for example, you can use the function `renderToNodeStream` to improve your load time.
