With the number of websites generated with the same tools, I tend to mutualize as much as we can the effort to maintain the common technical stack. Following this principle, I just created a new starter coming from some of my website development and powered with Gatsby.

You can find this starter on this [Github Repository](https://github.com/emmanuelgautier/gatsby-starter-netlify-tailwind). This repo contains an example business website that is built with:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

It follows the [JAMstack principles](https://jamstack.org) with Git as a single source of truth for pages and blog posts, deployed and delivered thanks to the solution [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

This starter is not strongly linked with Netlify so you can choose the hosting provider you want but, since this starter is using the Netlify CMS solution, the integration is simpler with Netlify.

## What are the main features?

This starter brings the following set of features:

- Pages and Blog posts content model
- Performance optimized with good Web Vitals scores
- SEO optimized
- Twitter Cards and Open Graph support
- RSS Feed
- Sitemap

Since this starter comes from my other websites developments, this list should bring most of the features you will need to build a website. If your think some features are missing or can be improved, feel free to contribute by making a PR or create an issue to ask about new features.

To see how it looks, please go to the deployed **[Demo Page](https://gatsby-starter-netlify-tailwind.netlify.app/)**.
