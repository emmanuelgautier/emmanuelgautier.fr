I'm excited to announce the launch of a new blog named [CerberAuth](https://www.cerberauth.com/), where I'll be exploring the world of OAuth, OpenID Connect, and IAM solutions for modern security. As a developer and security enthusiast, I've spent countless hours researching and experimenting with various IAM and OpenID Connect providers. With this blog, I hope to share some knowledge and experience with others who are interested in learning more about these topics.

In addition to sharing some thoughts and insights, I'll also be developing tools to make it easier for developers to implement and work with these technologies. I'm particularly excited about a new tool I've been working on that automatically generates secure OAuth2 rules from an OpenAPI contract (available on [Github](https://github.com/cerberauth/openapi-oathkeeper/)).

Whether you're a seasoned security expert or just getting started with these technologies, I hope you'll find the [CerberAuth blog](https://www.cerberauth.com/) informative and helpful. Stay tuned for more posts and updates.
