## The Challenge putting script tag content with Astro

While working on a project within the Astro framework, I encountered a scenario where I needed to fill HTML content within a `<script>` tag. However, the moment I implemented this, the smooth functioning of my web application turned into a jittery experience. It was clear that the `<script>` content was not playing well with the rest of the page.

```jsx
<script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify(schema)}</script>
```

But the render was not the one expected:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify(schema)}</script>
```

## How to inject HTML into an Astro element

After some investigation, I discovered that Astro web framework has his own way to inject HTML string into an element, the directive [set:html](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml).

For the developer more familiar with the React ecosystem, it is similar to the [React dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml)

Here is the final solution after reading the documentation:

```jsx
<script type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify(schema)} />
```

Hope that can help other developers!
