title: How to construct URI with URI Template
description: We often use predefined variables and template string to assemble URIs but there is a better approach called URI Template. This approach enables us to create URIs on-the-fly by replacing placeholders with actual data, making our code more flexible and maintainable.

Working with URIs in software development can sometimes be a challenging task, especially when we need to construct them dynamically. This is where URI templates, defined in [RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570), come into play. In this article, we'll explore the concept of URI templates and take a closer look at the details outlined in the RFC.

## RFC 6570

[RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570), titled "URI Template," is a specification that defines a compact syntax for expressing URLs and URI patterns. It provides a standardized way to generate URIs dynamically by allowing placeholders and variable substitution within a template. These templates are invaluable when building APIs, web applications, or any software that interacts with URIs.

## Syntax of URI Templates

The syntax of a URI template, as defined in RFC 6570, consists of literal characters and expressions enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Here are some examples:

- `{scheme}://{host}/{path}`
- `https://example.com/{resource}?id={id}&lang={lang}`

In these examples, `{scheme}`, `{host}`, `{path}`, `{resource}`, `{id}`, and `{lang}` are placeholders that can be replaced with actual values.


## URI Template Expressions

RFC 6570 defines various expression types that can be used within URL templates, including:
- **Simple String Expansion**: Represented as `{varname}` and are replaced by their corresponding values.
- **Reserved Expansion**: Represented as `{+varname}` and are used for expansion without percent encoding. Useful for query strings.
- **Fragment Expansion**: Represented as `{#varname}` and used for expansion within a URL fragment.
- **Label Expansion with Dot-Prefix**: Represented as `{.varname}` and used for dot notation in path segments.
- **Path Segment Expansion**: Represented as `{/varname}` and used for inserting values into path segments.
- **Query Expansion**: Represented as `{?varname}` and used for adding query parameters.
- **Continuation**: Represented as `{&varname}` and used to continue a query with additional parameters.

## Implementing URI Templates in code

To implement URI templates in your code, you can use libraries or built-in functions that support RFC 6570. Many programming languages have libraries that make working with URI templates straightforward. There is an existing Wiki page listing [RFC 6570 implementations](https://github.com/uri-templates/uritemplate-spec/wiki/Implementations).

For example, in Javascript, the `std-uritemplate` library provides robust support for URI templates. Here's a basic example in Javascript:

```javascript
const { StdUriTemplate } = require('@std-uritemplate/std-uritemplate');

url = StdUriTemplate.expand("https://example.com/{resource}/{id}", { resource: "users", id: 123 })
```
