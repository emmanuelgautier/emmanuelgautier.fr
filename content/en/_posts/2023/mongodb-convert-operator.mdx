MongoDB is a flexible and versatile database system that can handle a wide variety of data types. However, there are situations where you may need to change the data type of a document field during query execution. For example, you may want to convert a string field to a date field, or vice versa. Fortunately, MongoDB provides various aggregation operators, such as `$convert`, that allow you to manipulate document field types during query execution.

The `$convert` operator is a MongoDB aggregation pipeline stage that converts a value to a specified data type. It is useful when you want to convert a value in a document from one data type to another. This operator takes three parameters:

- `input`: The value to be converted
- `to`: The target data type to which the input value should be converted. Valid data types include "double", "string", "objectId", "bool", "date", "int", "long", "decimal", "timestamp", and "binary".
- `onError` (optional): Specifies the behavior in case an error occurs during the conversion. Valid options are "error", "null", or "skip".
- `onNull` (optional): Specifies the behavior in case of null value

More details and examples about the `$convert` operator are available on the [official MongoDB manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/convert/).

## MongoDB $convert example

Here's an example usage of the `$convert` operator to convert a string field to a date:

```
db.collection.aggregate([
   {
      $project: {
         convertedDate: {
          $convert: {
            input: "$stringField",
            to: "date",
            onError: {
              $concat:
                [
                  "Could not convert ",
                  { $toString: "$stringField" },
                  " to type integer."
                ]
            },
            onNull: null
          }
        }
      }
   }
])
```

In this example, we use the operator within a `$project` stage to convert the stringField to a date and store the result in a new field called convertedDate.

## Javascript MongoDB $convert Example

Here is the same example but with the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Replace the connection string with your own.
const uri = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
const client = new MongoClient(uri);

async function run() {
  try {
    await client.connect();

    const database = client.db('mydb');
    const collection = database.collection('mycollection');

    const pipeline = [
      {
        $project: {
          convertedDate: {
            $convert: {
              input: '$stringField',
              to: 'date',
              onError: {
                $concat:
                  [
                    'Could not convert ',
                    { $toString: '$stringField' },
                    ' to type integer.'
                  ]
              },
              onNull: null
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ];

    const result = await collection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
    console.log(result);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

run().catch(console.dir);
```
