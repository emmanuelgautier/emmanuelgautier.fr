If you are using Apache with PHP-FPM, PHP-CGI, or any other FastCGI implementation, you may have noticed that the `Authorization` header is missing in your code. This is because Apache removes the `Authorization` header for security reasons.

Authorization headers are used to send credentials to the server. They are used to authenticate the user and authorize access to resources. If the `Authorization` header is missing, your application won't be able to authenticate the user and authorize access to resources. It includes the `Bearer` token used in OAuth2 authentication, Basic authentication, and other authentication methods.

## Apache configuration

To fix this issue, you need to add the [CGIPassAuth](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/core.html#cgipassauth) directive to your Apache configuration. This directive tells Apache to pass the `Authorization` header to the FastCGI server.

Here is an example of how you can add the `CGIPassAuth` directive to your Apache configuration:

```bash
CGIPassAuth on
```

In your VirtualHost configuration, you can add the following configuration:

```bash
<VirtualHost *:80>
    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
</VirtualHost>
```

## .htaccess configuration

If you don't have access to the Apache configuration file, you can also add the CGIPassAuth directive to your `.htaccess` file. This will tell Apache to pass the `Authorization` header to the FastCGI server for the specific directory.

Here is an example of how you can add the `CGIPassAuth` directive to your `.htaccess` file:

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .+
RewriteRule ^ - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%0]
```
