This is officially my first newsletter issue! I'll be adding more content over the next few weeks. But for now, let's explain why and what this is all about.

OK. Creating a newsletter mid-2022 is a bit trendy. Otherwise, this newsletter is a way for me to test sharing some knowledge and experience different way than I normally do with blog posts.

## What will be the main topics of this newsletter?

I don't plan any specific topics for this newsletter for now. More probably, I will share different things and some of my thoughts on various topics.
